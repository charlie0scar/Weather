##Location-Analysis
Many Americans have relocated since the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic due to a rise in remote work. These relocations are often due to temperature, but the overall comfort of any given location is due to many more factors. Wind speed, cloud cover, annual rainfall, daily and annual temperature variation all heavily impact how "comfortable" the weather is. In this case we will take a dataset of Helena Montana's weather history from NOAA's weather data query and create a simple python script that summarizes wind, sunlight, snowfall, temperature variation and other factors that influence comfort.
